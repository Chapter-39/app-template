# Support Policy

- Scope: maintenance mode — critical bug fixes, security patches, and CI/docs chores only.
- How to file: open a GitHub issue using the Bug Report template.
- Response times: triage within 3–5 business days; resolution depends on severity and maintainer availability.
- Out of scope: new features, large refactors, and non-critical enhancements.
