# Brand Residue Audit

## Overview
- Scope: Searched the repository for case-insensitive occurrences of "solvo" and "nubo" in text sources.
- Exclusions: `node_modules`, `dist`, build outputs, lockfiles, and common binary/image formats.
- Result: No occurrences found.

## Findings by term
- solvo: 0 hits
- nubo: 0 hits

## Suggested neutral replacements
- None required, as no brand residues were found.
- General guidance (if encountered later): prefer "the project" or the repository name "app-template" in docs and metadata.

## Potential risks
- None identified from branding residues.
- If future references appear in code identifiers or published package names, avoid renaming without a deprecation plan.
